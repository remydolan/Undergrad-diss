# Undergrad-diss
Everything to do with my numerical analysis dissertation from my BSc (Hons) Maths and Physics.
I will soon be making the files fully Python 3 compatible, as well as adding full explanations for all the code from start to finish. The code is now Python 3 compatible. In order to run it using Python 2, the print statements must be reverted to the format print x, instead of print(x).
