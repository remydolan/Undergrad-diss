# Undergrad-diss
Everything to do with my numerical analysis dissertation from my BSc (Hons) Maths and Physics.
I will soon be making the files fully Python 3 compatible, as well as adding full explanations for all the code from start to finish. The only issue currently is the print statements should be in the form print(<thing to print>) but are in the form print <thing to print>. Everything else should work perfectly.
